jQuery Maximage is a lightweight and responsive fullscreen background slideshow that focusses on simplicity.

== Description ==

This plugin gives your WordPress Site a fullscreen background slideshow.
You can choose directly from the WordPress Media Uploader, which is fully integrated in the plugin.
jQuery Maximage uses the Maximage 2 Plugin for jQuery from Aaron Vanderzwan with the "classic" jQuery Cycle Plugin.

Also it's fully translatable.

= Why should I use jQuery Maximage? =

When I searched for a working background slideshow, which is very simple but working, I only found some Slideshows which are way to overpowered.
You just want a simple slideshow, but you get tons of confusing options and your client is simply overwhelmed. So I decided to write my own WP Plugin to offer a simple and easy-to-use background slideshow.
The work on this plugin will continue, but i will make sure to keep it simple.
